# Slice 'n Dice

High school capstone project of 2018. Slice 'n Dice is a desktop application written in Delphi (Pascal) and using a SQL database - my first fully fledged application.

Slice 'n Dice is a recipe manager which can keep stock of your kitchen inventory. This information is used to help present recipes that can be made with what is currently available in the kitchen. 
The application also extends itself to providing access to a shopping list based on recipes you set up, and then provides access to online shopping to order the necessary items. Alternatively, the shopping list 
can be printed or otherwise shared for physical trips to the store. 

Beyond this, you can plan your meals in Slice 'n Dice to further the effectiveness of the shopping list. The application also tracks previous meals you have eaten. Together, 
this can provide deep analytics into your eating habits. Slice 'n Dice has a basic analytics tab in which you can compare your true dietary in-take (based on the tracked meals) 
to the dietary goals you have set for yourself.

## Additional Notes

The application was coded on an old Delphi IDE I can no longer access; so although the structure is less than pleasant, there are no plans to fix the structure or any other issues that the code may possess. 
This only opens the possibility of breaking various things, and without the IDE, it would be cumbersome to test when the project is only saved here as an archive of my previous work and first full desktop application. 

This application helped me win the IT award at SACS, achieved 100% for the capstone project, and resulted in matriculating with 97% for IT.
